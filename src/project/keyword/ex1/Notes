DataProvider:
---------------------
- Read from excel file
- fetch the test data


- write the test cases in java

keyword driven:
------------------------------
- Read from excel file
- Read
  a) test data
  b) instruction
  
 
- write the test cases in excel file


Allows to write the test cases  in excel.
every row is a instuction 
every row has to perform certain action..
Every row in excel contains:
  1.ACTIONS 
  2.TEST DATA
  3.ASSERTIONS



steps:
--------------
Excel contains
-> multiple test cases
-> every test case contains multiple actions

convert every row to action obj.
One test case requires list of action objects.

For running test case we need multiple action objects.

->
1.Read the excel using apache poi
2.scan every row
3.read every row info and keep inside the action object
4.keep all action objs to the list
5.pass the list of action objects to the test class


/**
 - For every row create action obj
- keep all action objects inside the list
- every action has to be performed using KeyWordUtil.java
- in the KeyWordUtil.java for every keyword create a method.
- call the method based on the keyword configured in the excel.

classes:
--------------
1.Action 

2.KeyDrivenExcelUtils 
 -> convert row to action obj
 -> fetches all the action objects for every test case
 -> contains apache poi code

3.KeyWordUtil
- for every keyword create a method.
- call the method based on the keyword configured in the excel.

4.Test class
   -> requires KeyDrivenExcelUtils obj
      - get all the action objs for every test case
      
   -> requires KeyWordUtil obj
      - for every action obj call perform() method
