page object model:
------------------------


problem:
if a web page changed 
1.i.e. locators are changed
2. new fields added
3. existing fields modified

then we have to make java changes in severeal files


There are two types of classes:
- page class  [for every web page]
- test classes [for every web page]

 page class :
 ------------------------
1.for every  web page there is a Java class
2.the Page class contains
   - instance variables 
      [web element objects]
   - methods
      [every operation on the page ]
      - verifictaion
      - any action 
      

before POM:
-------------------
In a test class we are writing logic for 
A> identifying the web-elements
B> any action on web element

if we write A & B in test class it is difficult for reusabilty.
that why we are moving the logic to the page class.


With POM:
----------------
-> PAGE CLASS
-> TEST CLASS 
 

Steps:
----------------
1.create the page class
   -> write all webelements
   -> write all the methods
   
2.Create the test class
  -> create the object for page class
  -> call the methods using the page object
  
 create two packages:
-> pages
-> tests
