Functional Testing:
----------------------
-> done by tester.
-> blackbox testing
only on requirement based testing.
check the behaviour of system.
-> Testing the new features(Test cases) + existing features(regression) + Defects(reTesting).
db testing,
regression


-a) the new features(Test cases V-12 ) + ->Manual
 b) Defects(retesting Issues till v-11).  -> Manual
 c) existing features(regression v-11) +  ->manual/AUtomation . But preferred automation.

Regression Testing:
--------------------
a)Testing the existing/already delievered features.
b)Regression testing is required always:
-> Defect fix
-> New feature development
-> Perf fixes.
c) Adv: Avoids the side effects due to new features.
New feature should not break the existing features.
-> Regression is costly + time taking
-> Regression should be before the release to the customer.
-> Regression is per release.


ReTesting:
-----------
Retesting is testing only the area where issue/defect exists.
After Retesting we need to do the Regression Testing.

-> a) Tester created defect for login scenario
   b) Dev will fix the issue  and will assign defect back to tester for confirmation.
   c)Tester will retest only the login scenario.
   d) Tester closes the defect and repeat the same for all defects
   e) Perform Regression Testing before the delivery.

   
 Monkey Testing:
 ----------------
  -Test without testcase and without prior knowledge of the application.
  -create defect for any flaw identified.
