Functional Testing:
----------------------
-> done by tester.
-> blackbox testing
test based on the requirement sepcified during the analysis.
check the behaviour of system.
-> Testing the 
a)new features(Test cases) + 
b)existing features(regression) + 
c)Defects(reTesting).
d)db testing,


Funtional testing:
------------------
->Test New Features (using test cases)
-> Test Defects  (ReTesting )
-> Before Regression perform sanity + smoke
-> Regression  [just before the delivery]
-> Non Funtional Testing.
-> User Acceptance Testing  (customer)



Test strategy:
---------------------------
 a) the new features(Test cases V-12 ) + ->Manual
 b) Defects(retesting Issues till v-11).  -> Manual
 c) existing features(regression v-11)  ->manual/AUtomation . But preferred automation.


Regression Testing:
--------------------
a)Testing the existing/already delivered features.
b)Regression testing is required always:
-> Defect fix
-> New feature development
-> Performance fixes.
c) Adv: Avoids the side effects due to new features.
New feature should not break the existing features.
-> Regression is costly + time taking
-> Regression should be before the release to the customer.
-> Regression is per release.


ReTesting:
-----------
Retesting is testing only the area where issue/defect exists.
After Retesting we need to do the Regression Testing.

-> a) Tester created defect for login scenario
   b) Dev will fix the issue  and will assign defect back to tester for confirmation.
   c)Tester will retest only the login scenario.
   d) Tester closes the defect and repeat the same for all defects
   e) Perform Regression Testing before the delivery.

   
 Monkey Testing:
 ----------------
  -Test without testcase and without prior knowledge of the application.
  -create defect for any flaw identified.





Regression is costly + time consuming.
Perf testing follows after Regression.

Order:
--------
-> Test New Features (using test cases)
-> Test Defects  (ReTesting )
-> Regression  ------> Heavy + costly + time consuming.
-> Non Funtional Testing
-> UAT (customer)

Inroduce additional testing for Time saving:
-> Test New Features (using test cases)
-> Test Defects (ReTesting)
-> Smoke + Sanity Testing 
-> Regression  ------> Heavy + costly + time consuming.
-> Non Funtional Testing
-> UAT (customer)
