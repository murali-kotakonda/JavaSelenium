Order of testing :
-------------------------------
-> Funtional Testing for   New Features (using test cases)[only single env is enough]
-> Test Defects  (ReTesting )  [only single env is enough]
-> Regression  ------> Heavy + costly + time consuming. [run in all the spaces/env ]
-> Non Funtional Testing like perf , load , stress 
-> UAT (customer)



Regression is costly + time consuming.
Perf testing follows after Regression.

Introduce additional testing(Smoke Testing and Sanity Testing) for Time saving:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> Funtional Testing for  New Features (using test cases)
-> Test Defects (ReTesting)
-> Smoke + Sanity Testing 
-> Regression  ------> Heavy + costly + time consuming.
-> Non Functional Testing
-> UAT (customer)


Smoke Testing and Sanity Testing:
-------------------------------------
Smoke:
-------
- Build verification testing.
- mostly done using the jenins tool.
- check if the new build is stable.
- verify the app lauched successfully or is the deployment success and 
  check  installation is proper or check if the pages are responsive (in time/not at all).
- verify critical funtionality.
->Minor changes/fixes .
->if Smoke fails , then no need to go for regresion and create HIGH defect.

Sanity :
-----------
->UAT TESTING done by tester.
->new functionalities , bug fixes.
-> basic navigation, basic flow testing , 
->Minor changes/fixes .
->if sanity fails , then no need to go for regression and create defect.
