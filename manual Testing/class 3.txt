Types of s/w companies:
- Product based..
- Service based..


Product : 
build their own product and sell to market.

Target to developo s/w for multiple customers.
[Req gathering + Requiremnets + impl + dev + testing]
==>market analysis , predective analysis , study customers 
undertand need of customer and they develop the apaplication.
application is consumed by multi customers.
ex: 
win os , facebook , wats up, google , amazon...



Service based:
build product for other companies.

enduser --> abc corp  -----> Amazon
Requirement gather will be done by the abc corp and
development/testing/support is taken care by the Amazon company.


S/W company perform sdlc for a specific customer[business ].
Requirement gather will be done by the customer and
development is taken care by the s/w company.


software testing:
------------------
- is a phase of sdlc.
- aims at the capabilities of the application.
- intended to identify problem areas/bugs/issues/defect.

				 
Why Testing:
-> fixing the issue after delivery is expensive.
-> ensure the software is 100% bug free.
-> ensure app meets the quality [perf + funtional+ non -functional], stable , security.
-> ensure quality delivery.


Defect--> 
any scenario/ any test case which is not working as per customer specification..
- check whether application meets the customer requirements.
- identify any gaps/miscommunication.
- Tester is the 1st customer.

ex for defects:
correct creds + login failure --> critical defect.
login buton has to be in blue , was in red : low defect.
in fb , along with image upload , text msg is not added: medium


- based on impact to the application/flow/users testers has to decide the severity.


Requirement gap:
-----------
There is login page with username + password + login button.

for success login -> show home page
for all failure case -> show login page with error message  "invalid credentials."

test cases:
1. login name is corect  + pwd correct ---> show home page
2. login name is corect  + pwd wrong ---> show login page 
                 with msg invalid credentials.
3. login name is wrong  + pwd wrong ---> show login page 
                 with msg invalid credentials.


4. login name is corect  + pwd correct ,but account is locked
currently it is showing as:
"showing login page with msg invalid credentials."
 ---> show login page 
                 with msg acocunt locked.
--> show login page with error message "show acocunt locked."  [MISISNG TEST CASE]
				 
		

Nov 11th:
--------------
v20--> consumed by customer.[ login , inbox ]
V21---> 
New requiremnts[draft] + 10 defects for login,inbox.
Fix the defects first and then proceed with new requirements.


Testing:
1.Manual testing - no tool/technology for testing
- sql , sqldeveloper + any database
- process tools:  wiki , github ,svn , Jira, jenkins 

2.automation testing. 
-need tool/language for testing.
- java
- selenium
- html
- testng
- Maven
- Apache POI
- cucumber
- SQL



Quality:[from business view]
---------
-> Bug free
-> funtional is as expected
-> On time delivery ,[No extenstions...] 
-> On budget.
-> Performance [app should not slow]
-> app should support future requirements.
-> No crashes/ no conituous restarts.
