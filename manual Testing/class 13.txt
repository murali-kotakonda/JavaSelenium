verification vs validation:
-----------------------------

Verification:
------------------
before the application is ready.
correctness and completeness of the documents.ex: test case doc
before the application has been developed.
check are we going on right track.
are we planning to build the correct system??
Test case preparation + Reviews 
ex:unit testing


Validation:
------------------------
starts once the develop is completed and application is ready.
testing will happen on final product.
Validate what we build is correct.
Is the system meets the customer requirements?
what ever developed is working as per customer req.
ex: system testing,


Reviews:
---------
Requirement ( qa + PO)
test cases (qa lead)
test plan   (qa lead + architect)
design  (dev + architect )
code    (dev lead) 


Minimum levels of software testing:
-----------------------------------
Testing phase requires to do different types of testing.

1.Unit Testing    (white)  --> Dev
2.Integration testing (white) --> Dev 
3.System testing   (black) --> Tester
4.UAT [User Acceptance testing ] (black) --> Customer


1.Unit Testing:
- Tested by Dev
- Testing the single unit (smaller area) 
- write code to test the code
- Testing is done using the Code.
- Testing is not on the product functionality or on application ; 
testing is only on the code written by the developer.
- to be written by understanding the code.
ex: if we have login requiremnets:
we need write 4 functions (dev).
->input()   
	-> test the input() funtion by writing test cases  
->validate()
   -> test the validate() funtion by writing test cases
->process()
	-> test the process() funtion by writing test cases
->showResponse()
	-> test the showResponse() funtion by writing test cases
	
Frameworks used by developer for unitTesting:
---------------------------------------
ex: Junits, Mockito, easyMock

-> 



Integration testing: white box testing
-----------------------
-> its a white box testing module.
- done by developer.
- may be optional depends on the systems involved.
- testing is required only if there is an integration exits with 3rd party. 
integrate all software and start testing


case1:
-------

When one app has to communicate with another app(or multiple modules), 
then we need both the app to be integrated.

app1 connects with apps and sends the data.
app2 that received the data will process and send the response back to app1.
app1 has to understand the response from app2.
  
case2:
-----
Integration Testing becomes necessary after joining multiple modules.
- Component1[application] has some features
  Component2[application] has some diff features. 
-output of one application is the input for other application.

ex:
Component1 1: customer application 
Component1 2: Ticketing application 

Ticketing application  has to fetch the customer inform from the  "customer application"

ex: webservices
- application can have multiple modules.

Approaches:
-> top down:
-> bottom up


-> top down:
a)testing takes from top to bottom. [higher module to low module]
b)if Module A is ready and below Modules[lower modules]  are not available,then developer creates stubs.
 refer diagram topdown
 
-> bottom up
a) testing takes from bottom to up. [low module to higher module]
b) if Lower Module is ready and Higher Modules are not available,then developer creates driver.
-Each module at the lower level is tested with high modules until all modules are tested.

-> hybrid: Mix of both Top-Down and BottonUp



Myntra : owning the software
accenture : developing the  software

accenture has to complete:
- unit testing
- integration testing
- system testing


Myntra  has to do UAT testing


UserAcceptanceTesting:
--------------------------
- Done by the customers at their environment
- Testing is done on the final system
- Pre-production system.
- If there is an issue, then client creates defects and assigns to amazon


alpha : testing at developers site . system setup is done by accenture.
[mynta and accenture will participate with mock data]
Alpha Testing is a type of software testing performed to identify bugs before releasing the product to real users or to the public.
Alpha Testing is one of the user acceptance tests. It is the first stage of software testing, during which the internal development team tests the program before making it available to clients or people outside the company.



beta : testing at customers site with his own test data.
with realtime data.
[only myntra[Abc corp] will participate as real time data is invovled]
Beta Testing is performed by real users of the software application in a real environment. Beta testing is one type of User Acceptance Testing. A pre-release version of the product is made available for testing to a chosen set of external users or customers 
during the second phase of software testing.

-Acceptance criteria should be met for testing to be passed and that is validated by customer 

-Acceptance criteria should be met for testing to be passed and that is validated by customer
