Testing systems/environments/spaces:
-----------------------------------
refer the diagram


SDLC Models:
-----------
->phase/stages:


1.Water fall model
2.Incremental model
3.Spiral model
4.V model
5.Agile


waterfall:
--------------

Analyis + design + coding + unit testing+
testing + deployment + maintainance..

Problems:
----------------------------

->dev compltion takes almost 75% of the estimation.

-> Testers cannot start work until dev completes , but dev completion takes 5 months .
till 5 months testers are not utilized.
 No proper utilization of Team mates. 

->after the 5.5 months ,  tester created 500 defects ,
  Is it poissible to fix the 500 defects in remaining 15 days??
  No
  This leads to 
   a) postponing the delivery 
   b) Deliver bad product .

-> not realistic /suit for the real time/large  projects.   
-> risk involved  ( timely delivery , quality ).
-> small change/ gap identified the cycle will again starts from analysis.
going back to previous stage is complex/time consuming.
-> long term projects its not suitable.
-> testing starts  very late.
-> Defect fixing also starts very late .
  (errors can be fixed only after 5 months.)
-> customer [abc ] will see the outcome only after 6 month.
-> defect fixing happens before the delivery


Agile:
-----------------------------------------------

- process model that contains continuous iteration of the 
phases (coding / testing ) 

Analyis + design + coding + unit testing+
testing + deployment + maintainance..

- testing starts early
- defect fixing starts early
- all resources are properly utilized.
- any change in requiremnet can be adjusted.

-dev + testing will be happening at the same time.
-Divide and rule policy .
  - divide all requirements into Independent pieces. 
  - start life cycle for every Independent requirement.
- few requirements at a time
- parallel activities. 


  
50 Requirements :
--------------------
Divide all requirements into 5 sets :

  A         B        C         D        E 
10 Req + 10 Req  + 10 Req  + 10 Req  + 10 Req 

-> Complete the following life cycle for "A" within 2 weeks :
  1.Analysis  
  2.Design    
  3.Development 
  4.UnitTesting 
  5.Testing ( funtional/Regression/Perf..etc...)  ON "A", CREATE defects 

-> Complete the following life cycle for "B" within 2 weeks :
  1.Analysis  
  2.Design    
  3.Development 
  4.UnitTesting 
  5.Testing ( funtional/Regression/Perf..etc...) ON "A" , "B"
  6.Defect Fixing for "A"


-> Complete the following life cycle for "C" within 2 weeks :
  1.Analysis  
  2.Design    
  3.Development 
  4.UnitTesting 
  5.Testing ( funtional/Regression/Perf..etc...) ON "A" , "B" ,"C"
  6.Defect Fixing for "A" , "B"


-> Complete the following life cycle for "D" within 2 weeks :
  1.Analysis  
  2.Design    
  3.Development 
  4.UnitTesting 
  5.Testing ( funtional/Regression/Perf..etc...) ON "A" , "B" ,"C" ,"D"
  6.Defect Fixing for "A" , "B"  , "C"

-> Complete the following life cycle for "E" within 2 weeks :
  1.Analysis  
  2.Design    
  3.Development 
  4.UnitTesting 
  5.Testing ( funtional/Regression/Perf..etc...) ON "A" , "B" ,"C" ,"D" ,"E"
  6.Defect Fixing for "A" , "B"  , "C" , "E"


- customer(ABC) will see the outcome minimum for very month.
- error can be fixed much early , starts from 1st months.
- for every two weeks we have delivery .[small requirements]
- UAT testing starts early within 3 weeks.


- Agile always best model for complex projects.
-Agile is a process using which team will manage the software dev into several stages with continuous iteration .
- Agile starts with customer sharing the requiremnets + then perform stage by stage development in two weeks .
- every two weeks customer gives new requirements.
- Agile is set of principles that enables team to work flexibily, adapt based on project situation.
- Agile allows the team to work together efficiently + effectively
- constant colloboration and communication with customers.
- fill the gaps / clarifications/ expectations/gains trust...
-We can get constant feedback from customers.



Adv:
-----
-> test early + defect fix early
->For developer its easy to fix issues , and they will be very responsive.
->constant changes are allowed.
->constant communication between stackholders, business deligates, end customers .....
share the clear vision of status of the application so far.
->errors can be fixed early or in middle.
->analysis only for few requirements [to explore more].
->every iteration has its own testing strategy.
regression testing[ALL] every iteration.
->every month we will have a release to customer.
[satisfying few requirements...]
