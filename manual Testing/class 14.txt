White box testing: -Developer
-------------------
-test the internal working or code.
- test the code by writing the test cases.
-done by developers by understanding the coding.
-test based on coding point of view.
- focus/test only for code coverage
ex: unit testing + integration testing.
dev has to write Junits test cases using code.

tech: junits, mockito , easymock , RestEasy


Black Box testing:Tester
-------------------
- test on the application.
- write/run test cases for the functionality.
- test by understanding the requirements.
- testing is done by testers.
- test based on the customer point of view.
- test flows/functional/behaviour of application. - scenario coverage
ex: system testing  ( Usability + functional + non functional.) , UAT


Grey testing: Dev + Tester
--------------
combination of whitebox + black box.
ex: database testing


install :
oracle xe 11g download
https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/xe-downloads.html


System testing:
---------------
- test the integrated system , final product.
-Test the entire application functionality w.r.t the test cases.
- done by testing team.
- black box(without knowing coding)



different types of system testing:
---------------------------------
Decided during the Test planning

1.Usability Testing
2.Functional Testing: 
3.NonFunctional Testing: 
4.UAT


Usability testing:
------------------
-> Test How comfortable is the customer in using the applIcation & in accessing the features
-> Test the ease in accessing the web pages.
-> Focus on how end-users can understand and operate the app
-> Test the flexibility in handling controls.
-> check if any help or documentation is available or any FAQ's.
ex: Orkut [dead] , Facebook , Google plus[dead] , myspace[dead].
ex: watsup.
 



->Non-Funtional Testing:
Test the stability in terms of speed,security,recovery, handling load.
   a)Perf  - Load + Stress (Tester)
   b)Security
   c)Compatability
   d)Installation
   e)Hardware/SOftware Testing
   f)Recovery (Tester)
   g)Migration (Tester)
   h)Protocol/network/Mobile/Embedded device
   I)configuration testing
   j)sanitation testing
->UAT

sanitation testing:
---------------------
check if the app is providing any extra features beyond the customer requirements.
aplication has to provide the features as decided in the analysis; any extra features should not be added.


Performance testing:
--------------------
We need seperate system for perf testing
We need perf tools Like load runner, jmeters.
Done by testing + perf team.
-
>Load Testing:
a)Test the speed of the application.
b)Test by increasing the no of users ex: 50, 100, 1000, 2000 users  + increase the load.
find min , max , average  response times
c) goal is identify the Threshold.(max respon time) per page.
ex: test based on the current usage.

->Stress Testing :
Test the app and check how the app is handling the stress.
ex:
Test with 1lakh records with 10 lakh customers .
what is the memory occupany + cpu occupancy + res time + load on db + instances availability + load balancer.
-> Test the app to saturation point considering future.


diff between load vs stress testing


Security Testing:
-----------------------
Done by security specialist.
Should not expose cust data , privacy 
Make sure app is away from frauds, hacking.
Ex: 
->Login authentication ; only successul login with valid creds can able to visit the home page.
->Permissions ,privilages, roles set for the users.
->data sent secured .
->encrypt/decrpt the data for msg transfer.


Recovery Testing:
-----------------
->Test whether app is able to recover after crash.
->Is the recovery helpful to customer ??
-> is there any loss of data ?? any possibility for recover the data?? 
->any possibility for previous state before crash/ restore to earlier state.
-> % of recovery will help to understand the realiability of the app.
ex: mostly to applicable to GUI apps.

Compatability:
--------------
-> mostly to applicable to GUI apps and some cases for web apps.
compatability in terms of:
a) Multi os
b) 32/64 bit
c) diff processor
d) browsers  ( testers )
e) is it backward compatabile??? (testers)
ex:MS office supports .doc and .docx 

Installation testing:
---------------------
-> applicable for GUI and web
-> done by testers/ configuration team.
Test:
a)Test installation on diff platforms.
b)Test if the install steps are clear 
c)guidelines  for installation
d)Test time taken + slowness + unsuccessfull installtion.
e)Is it installing in the path specified by customer?
f)were the process added?? were registry entry made successfuly?
g)If already istalled??  what will happen if We reinstall
h)Test uninstallation.


Migration Testing:
-------------------
-> it is very often that we do the migration.
-> Testing required when we do the migration .
Ex: 
a) Migrate the db (oracle ---> Mysql)
b) Migrate the data form one format to other format.
ex: .avi , .mp4 , .VOB
c) Migrate form older infrastruture to new infrastructure
ex: from win 7 to mac.

Test: 
a) If the data still exists post migration .
is there any loss of data??
b) Were the features exists as before??
