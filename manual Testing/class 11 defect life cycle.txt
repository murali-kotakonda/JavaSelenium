when do you created defect:
--------------------
when the expected and actual are not matching 

Every defect created by tester should contain:
-----------------------------------------------------------
- detailed steps to be followed for reproducing the issue 
Additional information to reproduce the issue, e.g. server, browser version, operating system, ...
- what is expected and what is the actual from application.
- priority (high/medium/low/very high)
- Enviroment(sandbox/commit/live).
- which browser 
- what is the request data used in the scenario.
- Log statements.

Where should we create defect or what is the defect tracking tool?
JIRA

  

- Every defect has a state

States:
---------
-> New (Defect created by tester with details...)

-> Open :
Scrum master assign the defect to any of the developer.
Assigning to developer and start analysis. or atleast the RCA [Root cause analysis].
if the defect is invalid then mark as Reject/Duplicate/Not Reproduable.

-> In-progress :
Defect is accepted and dev chages are in progress.


-> Author action [clarification required]:
info provided by tester is not sufficient.
dev needs additional info .
then defect falls under tester place 

-> Dev close /Fixed : 
 - When developer makes necessary code changes and verifies the fix is addressed 
   then he will make defect status as "Fixed" and the defect is passed to testing team.
   developer need to inform when the new changes will be available.,
  
  
-> Retesting:
Re-testing has to be done testers end.
try to execute the same test case and check if the issue is addressed.
try to run the regression and check the fix is not breaking other features.

-> Reopen
 If the defect still exists even after the bug is fixed by the developer, the tester changes
the status to "Reopened" and the defect is passed to dev team.

-> Reject/Duplicate/Consultation/Not Reproduable


-> Test completed/Verified
Mark as Test completed when the testings are completed and successfull.
check if the new test case has to be written or not.
  
  
-> Closed
Once the bug is fixed and it is tested by the tester.
Closed  means that the bug is fixed, tested and approved.
