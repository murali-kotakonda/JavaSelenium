Manual Testing:
-----------------
-Test cases are executed manually by tester , without using any tool.
-Any new feature must be first tested manually and then has to be tested using automation.
-Requires more effort, time.
-100% automation is not possible, manual Testing is reliable.
- checks the quality of the system and delivers bug-free product to the customers.
- possible check every inch of the application; 
- No tool , no code , no script 
- less investment
- depends on user experience + human observation.
- tester needs to be very patient, creative &  open minded.
- testing is repetitive and boring.
- Not a virtual testing , its more like visualy testing + real/live testing.
- reporting we will use excel sheet

  
when should we do manual testing:
-----------------------------------
- use when automation testing is not applicable.
- short term projects (low invest + time constraint)
- long term project (initial stages till the app is stable)
- Test Cases for which the requirements are frequently  changing.
- adhoc testing.
- GUI application 
- defect tracking and analysis 



How to perform Manual Testing:
------------------------------------
- Understand Requirements
- Prepare test plan and test cases document and RTM document.
- Review the test cases  ( QA lead) and correct the test cases. 
- Prepare the environment.ex: creating test data,db data etc....
- Excute the test cases manually on the application and update the test case document
- Create defects if the app fails to meet the requirements ; using JIRA or any defect tracking tool.
- Retest once the defect is fixed.
- Update the test status in the excel [for status column mark as "success" or "fail"]
- Prepare the test report using excel or any other presentation to the team.
  


Automation testing:
--------------------
- Execute the test cases using the automation tool/software.
- saves time, effort 
- convert every test case into a script using code/tool.
and generate reporting using tool.
- no human intervention required. We can record and play the test cases .


Why automation?
---------------------
- Manual is time and money consuming
- testing the multilingual[multi lang] is easy
- completes the test execution early.
- does not require Human intervention.
 We can schedule the test case to run at any time (using jenkins).
- helps increase Test Coverage
- helps reporting the test results.
- perf , load testing ,security .
- high accuracy.
- good for long term projects.
- test cases repeatedly executed/time-consuming.
-  regression testing can be completed in short time. 
- multi browser testing and parallel testing is simpified  and tested at the same time.
		In sequential :
		---------------------------
		assume testing 1000 tests cases takes 2 hours

		- test the 1000 test cases on chrome
		-test the 1000 test cases on firefox
		- test the 1000 test cases on internet explorer


		time taken:  6 hours

		In parallel :
		--------------------------------------------
		assume testing 1000 tests cases takes 2 hours

		- test the 1000 test cases on chrome
		-test the 1000 test cases on firefox
		- test the 1000 test cases on internet explorer


		time taken:  2 to 3 hours


how to do automation testing:
------------------------------
- Select the automation tool suitable for the project and the type of testing.
- Understand Requirements
- Prepare test plan and test cases document and RTM doc
- Review the test cases ( QA lead) and correct the test cases. 
- Prepare the environment.ex: creating test data,db data etc....
- for every test case in excel write the respective code/script accordingly 
and make sure all test cases must have a ( script/code) .
- Execute the test cases using the automation tool.
- Tool generates Report automatically.
Check the report for any test failures.
- For test failure:
  a) confirm if it is a defect [test manually]
  b) check if it is a false alarm.
- Create defects for all the failed test cases ; using JIRA or any defect tracking tool.
- Retest once the defect is fixed.
- Prepare the test report using report generated by the tool to the team.
