Why do we have bugs/defects:
----------------------------
-> bad code practices
-> Requirement gap
-> Missing scenario/ missing test case [ignorance].
-> edge scenario [unexpected].
ex: 
every department has multi employees.
requirement : show department 
->if customer clicks on department  then show department details and all the employees.

tester way :
1.create department 
2.Add employees under department
3.click on the "show  Department"
[department + employees  are shown]

-> customer way
1.create department without employees. 
2.click on the "show  Department"
[department should not shown]

business case:
-> create department today.
-> and add employees after next week.
 
-> Bad coding practises.- [developers]
-> change in requirement in between 
-> faster delivery , [testing is not done 100%]
   lack of time
-> load/perf test is not appropiate.
-> testing is not done well by testers.- lack of intent
-> as customers increases , the no of requests increases that leads to performance.

testing steps:
--------------
-> write test cases
-> test data creation.  [ex: registration , signup, create account] 
-> test executions   , login success, login failure, 
-> for every test execution validate the expected and actual
-> test data cleanup [clean data used for registration].
->reporting the test results and share with the team.
-> for failed test cases create defects

SKills for tester:
-------------------
-> Understanding system + requirements.
-> Follow Testing process/protocal.
-> Estimation. ex: time required for testing.
-> Comunication skills + analytical skills.
-> Puntucal + Time mgmt.
-> Documentation.
[write article abt the requirements/testcases/test plan.]
->  commitment , intent towards work.

Technial skills required for tester:
-----------------------------------
- Defect Tool is a software for managing the defects.
- WiKI  [Documentation].
- Agile [JIRA].type of sdlc
- Database query techniques.[sql for db]
- Domain.
- Linux/Unix commands.[No GUI].
- Excel and presentation skills.
- Automation tools. EX: SELENIUM, QTP, TOSQA
- Jenkins[auto build job ], Cloud understandings[depends on projects].
- ISTQB (optional).
